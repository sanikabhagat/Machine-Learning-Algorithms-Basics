# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Basics

## What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

Using algorithms that iteratively learn from data, machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed where to look.

This repository has a basic explanation of all the Machine Learning algorithms explored by me along with an easy example. Every folder inside this repository is reserved for one algorithm


### Instructions to Download and Run the Project:
Each of the project folders in this repository has .ipynb files which are the Jupyter notebooks and the data files.
Download the Project folder and run the .ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook
